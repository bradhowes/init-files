# Emacs Configuration

Current configuration files:

- [early-init.el](early-init.el) -- early steps to reduce startup times
- [init.el](init.el) -- contains normal session configuration
- [custom.el](custom.el) -- contains customized settings
- [lisp](lisp) -- directory containing various mode hooks and functions

Old-school configuration files kept for posterity. Lots of it come from when I first began using Emacs back in v18 time,
and a brief detour to XEmacs on Solaris when it appeared Emacs was stuck in the mud. Now, XEmacs is pretty much dead and
buried.

- [dot\_emacs.old](dot_emacs.old) -- was originally named `.emacs` and found in my home directory
- [elisp](elisp) -- old-style equivalent of [lisp](lisp) directory above, but with a [startup.el](elisp/startup.el) file
  that served as a byte-compiled `init.el` file.
