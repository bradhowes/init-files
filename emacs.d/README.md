# Emacs Configuration

Current configuration files:

- [early-init.el](early-init.el) -- early steps to reduce startup times
- [init.el](init.el) -- contains normal session configuration
- [custom.el](custom.el) -- contains customized settings
- [lisp](lisp) -- directory containing various mode hooks and functions

# Historical

Old-school Emacs configuration files kept for posterity. Lots of it come from when I first began using Emacs back in v18
time, and a brief detour to XEmacs on Solaris when it appeared Emacs was stuck in the mud. Now, XEmacs is pretty much
dead and buried.

- [dot\_emacs.old](dot_emacs.old) -- was originally named `.emacs` and found in my home directory
- [lisp/old](lisp/old) -- old versions of [lisp](lisp) directory contents, but with a [startup.el](elisp/old/startup.el)
  file that served as a byte-compiled `init.el` file. Some functionality has been kept in some form in the [lisp](lisp)
  directory.
